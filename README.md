# Bank-Customer-Churn
In this capstone project, I focused on addressing the problem of customer churn within the banking industry. The 
dataset I worked with consisted of 10,000 rows and had 18 columns.
Initially began with Data cleaning, data preprocessing, followed by in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) 
exploring the distribution of credit scores among customers patterns of customer churn across demographics, 
Visualizations to see relation between Age and churn, Gender and Churn using Python.
In parallel, I utilized SQL queries to perform detailed analyses uncovering insights like churn rates by country, 
gender, and age groups, the influence of credit scores, credit card ownership, and customer complaints on churn rates.
Developed interactive dashboards using Tableau that allowed users to explore and interact with the data Through 
various types of charts and graphs which helped uncover trends.
Based on the analysis, several actionable recommendations were identified to reduce customer churn. Retention
strategies for high churn rate in Germany, strengthening relationships with active members through special perks,
Retention strategies targeting DIAMOND cardholders, Continuous monitoring of churn patterns and adaptation of 
strategies.
